# Geo Location

This project is a small geo location application.

It consists of a small React frontend and a small Express backend. 

The frontend displays an interactive map. 
It renders points within the viewport and highlights points belonging to the closest route in red when you click on a location.

The backend provides geo location endpoints to find routes closest to a given location and to find points within a given viewport. 

## Usage

In [frontend](frontend/) you have detailed instructions for running the application frontend. 
In [backend](backend/) you have detailed instructions for running the application backend. 

If you decide to use docker, after building the images, you can run both frontend and backend using docker-compose:
`sudo docker-compose up`
